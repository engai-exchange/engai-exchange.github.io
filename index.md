# The EngAI Group Exchange Sessions

The EngAI Group Exchange Sessions aim to foster communication and collaboration among researchers, practitioners, and students working in various engineering fields, with a particular emphasis on the transformative role of AI and emerging technologies. The sessions will critically explore key topics at the intersection of engineering disciplines and AI, generate innovative ideas, promote interdisciplinary learning, and build a community to address real-world engineering challenges. By bringing together diverse expertise, the goal is to accelerate advancements in areas like sustainable design, automation, and intelligent systems, while encouraging ethical and practical discussions.

We will be having weekly sessions (on **Mondays, 1-2pm PT**) where our invited guests will present their work or a journal club paper followed by an interactive discussion and Q&A among all participants. Sessions will be recorded or livestreamed based on presenters' consent and the recordings will be available for viewership later. Check our [About]({{ 'about' | relative_url}}) page for more details.
